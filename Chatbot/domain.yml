  utter_requirement_voting_absentee_ballot:
  - text: "Voters unable to vote in person on Election Day may be eligible to vote by absentee ballot. Most absentee voters must appear before the Circuit Clerk or Municipal Clerk, and absentee vote in person. A few categories of absentee voters may request a mailed ballot. Voters, who are required to be at work while the polling places are open on Election Day or will be out of town, must absentee vote in person. Absentee voters, who are 65 or older, have a permanent or temporary physical disability, or are temporarily residing outside their county of residence may absentee vote by mail. Please check with your Circuit or Municipal Clerk to determine if you are entitled to vote by an absentee ballot and to learn the procedures for doing so. If you know you will vote by absentee ballot, you may visit or contact your Circuit or Municipal Clerk’s Office within 45 days of the election. Voters included within the Uniform and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), such as members of the military and overseas citizens, may register to vote and request an absentee ballot by Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). UOCAVA voters may register to vote using the FPCA until ten days before an election and may receive and return an absentee ballot by mail, email, or fax. Absentee ballots are now final votes. If you cast an absentee ballot, you may no longer cast a regular ballot on Election Day, but you may cast an affidavit ballot. If you know you will vote by absentee ballot, you may visit or contact your Circuit or Municipal Clerk’s Office within 45 days of the election. For more information, call the Secretary of State’s Election Hotline at 1-800-829-6786 or visit our website at www.yallvote.ms"
